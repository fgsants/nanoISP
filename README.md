# nanoISP
nanoISP is a little project to manage and control pppoe users in an ISP enviroment focusing integration with Ubiquiti's EdgeMAX routers for traffic shapping. ItÂ´s my first step towards an ISP Management ecosystem and my first opensource project.

To acomplish this I'll use...
  * FreeRADIUS - for user authentication
  * node.js - as environment for the app backend
  * Electron - as the app frontend
  * MySQL Server - as information storage
  * ... and of course, an EdgeMAX router for field-testing :P
